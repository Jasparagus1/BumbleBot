## Oct. 28
- See [Whiteboards Oct 28](Whiteboards/Oct%2028).
- Brainstormed behaviors for our robot to carry out, chose Pollination/Waggle Dance.
- Outlined goals and steps needed in programming.
- Separated potential goals into:
  -  Finding Flower & Basic Dance
  -  Actually Pollinating Somehow
  -  Making a Second Robot Capable of Following the First's Instructions

## Nov. 4
- Started editing the original source code.
- Got the Search and Flower modes working with [Search Flower V1](search%20flower%20v1).
- Then we tried to integrate our previous Braitenberg-style light seeking behavior to improve the flower-finding abilities. This proved tricky. See [Search Flower Braitenberg](search%20flower%20braitenberg).
  - Experimented with higher and lower light thresholds to see if that would fix the problem, ended up choosing to angle our sensors.
