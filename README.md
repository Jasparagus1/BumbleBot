We started editing the original source code.
Got the Search and Flower modes working with [Search Flower V1](search%20flower%20v1).
Then we tried to integrate our previous Braitenberg-style light seeking behavior to improve the flower-finding abilities.
This proved tricky. See [Search Flower Braitenberg](search%20flower%20braitenberg).
